# Hand Detection and Gesture Recognition

This Python project detects hand gestures using the MediaPipe Hands module and performs operations based on the raised fingers.

## Description

This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect hands in a video stream captured from a webcam. It then analyzes the hand gestures, such as clenched fists, raised fingers, and thumb gestures, and prints the corresponding messages to the terminal.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and gesture recognition
- Detection of clenched fists, raised fingers, and thumb gestures
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe

You can install these dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
